## Async Await

### Basic Rules :

```
- Must need a function
- The function must be async
- Await must used inside async functions
- Must call the function
```

### Fetch :

```
- Fetch call/ fetch():
- - Fetch API returns Promise
- First callback:
- - Response to Json
- Second callback:
- - Consume data
```

##### N.B : Node.js not support Fetch. But support axios/node-fetch/other packages.

### Advantage of Async Await

- Nested async callback problem fixed.
- Complex async task easily manageable with sync task.
- Readability increase.
